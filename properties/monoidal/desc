A model structure $\mathbf{C}$ is \emph{(symmetric) monoidal} if it is equipped with a closed (symmetric) monoidal structure $(\mathbf{C}, \otimes, I)$ such that the two following compatibility conditions are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item (Pushout-product axiom) For every pair of cofibrations $f \colon X \to Y$ and $f' \colon X' \to Y'$, their pushout-product
$$(X \otimes Y') \bigsqcup_{X \otimes X'} (Y \otimes X')\to Y \otimes Y'$$
is also a cofibration.  Moreover, it is a trivial cofibration if either $f$ or $f'$ is.
\item (Unit axiom) For every cofibrant object $X$ and every cofibrant resolution $0 \hookrightarrow QI \to I$ of the tensor unit, the induced morphism $QI \otimes X \to I \otimes X$ is a weak equivalence.  (Note that this holds automatically in the case that $I$ is cofibrant).
\end{enumerate}
