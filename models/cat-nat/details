\subsection{Description of the Underlying Category}

We will denote by $\textbf{Cat}$ the (large) 1-category whose objects are small categories and whose morphisms are functors.

\subsection{Description of Model}

\begin{definition}
A functor $F \colon \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}$ is an \emph{equivalence of ctegories} if it is fully faithful and essentially surjective.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A functor $F \colon \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}$ is an \emph{isofibration} if for any object $c \in \mathbf{C}$, and any isomorphism $\phi \colon F(c) \cong d$, there exists an isomorphism $\psi \colon c \cong c'$ such that $F(\psi)=\phi$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Theorem 3.1]{Rez96}}]
There is a cofibrantly generated model structure on $\textbf{Cat}$, called the \emph{natural model structure}, and denoted $\textbf{Cat}_\text{Nat}$, where a functor $F \colon \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{D}$ is a:
\begin{itemize}
\item Weak equivalence if it is an equivalence of categories.
\item Fibration if it is an isofibration.
\item Cofibration if it is injective on objects.
\end{itemize}
The generating cofibrations are given by $u \colon \emptyset \to \mathbf{0}$, $v \colon \mathbf{1}^\cdot \to \mathbf{1}$ and $w \mathbf{P} \to \mathbf{1}$. Here, $\mathbf{0}$ is the category with a single object and its identity arrow, $\mathbf{1}$ is the ctegory with two objects and a single non-identity arrow between them, $\mathbf{1}^\cdot$ is the maximal subcategory of $\mathbf{1}$ not containing this map, and $\mathbf{P}$ is the category consisting of a pair of parallel arrows.
\end{proposition}

Clearly every category is both fibrant and cofibrant in this model structure, and consequently it is both left anf right proper.

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Theorem 5.1]{Rez96}}]
The model structure $\textbf{Cat}_\text{Nat}$ is a closed monoidal model category.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Theorem 6.2]{Rez96}}]
The model structure $\textbf{Cat}_\text{Nat}$ is a simplicial model category.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Additional Information}

\begin{itemize}
\item This model structure has the interesting propery that it is canonical. That is, it is the only model structure on $\textbf{Cat}$ with these weak equivalences~\cite{Pri12}.  
\end{itemize}
