\subsection{Description of the Underlying Category}

We will denote by $\textbf{Cat}$ the (large) 1-category whose objects are small categories and whose morphisms are functors.

\subsection{Description of Model}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Theorem 3.1]{Rez96}}]
There is a cofibrantly generated model structure on $\textbf{Cat}$, called the \emph{natural model structure}, and denoted $\textbf{Cat}_\text{Nat}$, where a functor $f \colon X \to Y$ is a:
\begin{itemize}
\item Weak equivalence if it is an equivalence of categories.
\item Fibration if it is an isofibration.
\item Cofibration if it is injective on objects.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Additional Information}

\begin{itemize}
\item This model structure has the interesting propery that it is canonical. That is, it is the only model structure on $\textbf{Cat}$ with these weak equivalences~\cite{Pri12}.  
\end{itemize}
