\subsection{Description of the Underlying Category}

Let $\Delta$ be the simplex category.  That is, $\Delta$ is the category whose objects are linearly ordered sets $[n]=\{0,1,.dots,n\}$ for $n \geq 0$, and whose morphisms are order preserving functions.  The category of \emph{simplicial sets} is then the presheaf category $\textbf{sSet} := \textbf{Set}^{\Delta^{op}}$.  We can provide a combinatorial description of simplicial objects as follows.

\begin{definition}
A \textit{simplicial set} $X_\bullet$ is a collection of sets $X_n$ for all $n \geq 0$, and for each $n$ we have \textit{face maps} $d_i \colon X_n \to X_{n-1}$  and \textit{degeneracy maps} $s_i \colon X_n \to X_{n+1}$ satisfying the following relations:
$$d_i  d_j = d_{j-1} d_i \qquad 0 \leq i < j \leq n$$
$$s_i s_j= s_{j+1} s_{i} \qquad \; 0 \leq i \leq j < n$$
$$d_i s_j = \begin{cases}
 s_{j-1} d_i & \quad \qquad 0 \leq i < j < n \\
  \text{Id} & \qquad  \quad 0 \leq j < n \text{ and } i=j \text{ or } i=j+1 \\
  s_j d_{i-1} & \qquad \quad 0 \leq j \text{ and } j+1 < i \leq n
\end{cases}$$
\end{definition}

For more information on this category, see \cite{Fri12,May67,Rie08}.

\subsection{Description of Model}

\begin{definition}
Let $\Delta[n] = \Delta(-,[n])$ be the standard $n$-simplex formed via the Yoneda embedding in $\textbf{sSet}$.  For each $0 \leq i \leq n$, the \emph{$(n,i)$-horn} is the sub-simplicial set $\Lambda^i[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ which is the union of all faces except the $i^\text{th}$ one.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A map of simplicial sets $f \colon X \to Y$ is an \textit{inner Kan fibration} if it has the right lifting property for all inner horn inclusions.  That is, for all $0 < k < n$, we have the following commutative diagram:
$$\xymatrix{\Lambda^k[n] \ar[d] \ar[r] & X \ar[d]^f \\
\Delta[n] \ar[ur]|{\exists} \ar[r] & Y}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A map $f \colon X \to Y$ in $\widehat{\Delta}$ is a \textit{monomorphism} if it is level-wise injective.  That is, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is an injection of sets $f_n \colon X_n \to Y_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A map $f \colon X \to Y$ of simplicial sets is a \emph{weak categorical equivalence} if for all inner Kan complexes $A$,  the induced map of simplicial sets $\text{hom}(Y,A) \to \text{hom}(X,A)$ induces an isomorphism  after applying the functor $\tau_0$ which takes a simplicial set to the set of isomorphism classes of objects of its fundamental category.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Theorem 2.2.5.1]{Lur09}}]
There is a left proper, combinatorial model structure on $\textbf{sSet}$, called the \textit{Joyal model structure}, denoted $\textbf{sSet}_\text{Joyal}$, which is determined by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Weak equivalences are the weak categorical equivalences.
	\item Fibrant objects are the inner Kan complexes (also known as quasi-categories).  
	\item  Cofibrations are the monomorphisms.
\end{itemize}
The cofibrations are generated by the boundary inclusions $\partial \Delta[n] \to \Delta[n]$.  However, there is no known description of the generating trivial cofibrations.
\end{proposition}

As the cofibrations are the monomorphisms, all objects will be be cofibrant.

\begin{remark}[{\cite[Theorem 2.2.2.5.3]{Lur09}}]
$\textbf{sSet}_\text{Joyal}$ is not right proper.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Additional Information}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\textbf{sSet}_\text{Joyal}$ is Quillen equivalent to the Dwyer-Kan model structure on the category of simplicial categories~\cite{Ber10}.
\item This model structure can be obtained as a Cisinski model structure using the localiser consisting of the spine inclusions $\{\operatorname{Sp}[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]\}$~\cite{Ara14}. 
\end{itemize}
