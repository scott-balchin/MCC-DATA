\subsection{Description of the Underlying Category}

Let $\Delta$ be the simplex category.  That is, $\Delta$ is the category whose objects are linearly ordered sets $[n]=\{0,1,.dots,n\}$ for $n \geq 0$, and whose morphisms are order preserving functions.  The category of \emph{simplicial sets} is then the presheaf category $\textbf{sSet} := \textbf{Set}^{\Delta^{op}}$.  For more information on this category, see \cite{Rie08,May67,Fri12}.

\subsection{Description of Model}

\begin{definition}
Let $\Delta[n] = \Delta(-,[n])$ be the standard $n$-simplex formed via the Yoneda embedding in $\textbf{sSet}$.  For each $0 \leq i \leq n$, the \emph{$(n,i)$-horn} is the sub-simplicial set $\Lambda^i[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ which is the union of all faces except the $i^\text{th}$ one.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A map of simplicial sets $f \colon X \to Y$ is an \textit{inner Kan fibration} if it has the right lifting property for all inner horn inclusions.  That is, for all $0 < k < n$, we have the following commutative diagram:
$$\xymatrix{\Lambda^k[n] \ar[d] \ar[r] & X \ar[d]^f \\
\Delta[n] \ar[ur]|{\exists} \ar[r] & Y}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A map $f \colon X \to Y$ in $\widehat{\Delta}$ is a \textit{monomorphism} if it is level-wise injective.  That is, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is an injection of sets $f_n \colon X_n \to Y_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Theorem 2.2.5.1]{Lur09}}]
There is a left proper, combinatorial model structure on $\textbf{sSet}$, called the \textit{Joyal model structure}, denoted $\textbf{sSet}_\text{Joyal}$, which is determined by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fibrant objects are the inner Kan complexes (also known as quasi-categories).  
	\item  Cofibrations are the monomorphisms.
\end{itemize}
The cofibrations are generated by the boundary inclusions $\partial \Delta[n] \to \Delta[n]$.  However, there is no known description of the generating trivial cofibrations.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}[{\cite[Theorem 2.2.2.5.3]{Lur09}}]
$\textbf{sSet}_\text{Joyal}$ is not right proper.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Additional Information}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\textbf{sSet}_\text{Joyal}$ is Quillen equivalent to the Dwyer-Kan model structure on the category of simplicial categories~\cite{Ber10}.
\item This model structure can be obtained as a Cisinski model structure using the localiser consisting of the spine inclusions $\{\operatorname{Sp}[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]\}$~\cite{Ara14}. 
\end{itemize}
