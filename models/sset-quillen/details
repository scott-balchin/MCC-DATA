\subsection{Description of the Underlying Category}

Let $\Delta$ be the simplex category.  That is, $\Delta$ is the category whose objects are linearly ordered sets $[n]=\{0,1,.dots,n\}$ for $n \geq 0$, and whose morphisms are order preserving functions.  The category of \emph{simplicial sets} is then the presheaf category $\textbf{sSet} := \textbf{Set}^{\Delta^{op}}$.  We can provide a combinatorial description of simplicial objects as follows.

\begin{definition}
A \textit{simplicial set} $X_\bullet$ is a collection of sets $X_n$ for all $n \geq 0$, and for each $n$ we have \textit{face maps} $d_i \colon X_n \to X_{n-1}$  and \textit{degeneracy maps} $s_i \colon X_n \to X_{n+1}$ satisfying the following relations:
$$d_i  d_j = d_{j-1} d_i \qquad 0 \leq i < j \leq n$$
$$s_i s_j= s_{j+1} s_{i} \qquad \; 0 \leq i \leq j < n$$
$$d_i s_j = \begin{cases}
 s_{j-1} d_i & \quad \qquad 0 \leq i < j < n \\
  \text{Id} & \qquad  \quad 0 \leq j < n \text{ and } i=j \text{ or } i=j+1 \\
  s_j d_{i-1} & \qquad \quad 0 \leq j \text{ and } j+1 < i \leq n
\end{cases}$$
\end{definition}

For more information on this category, see \cite{Fri12,May67,Rie08}.

\subsection{Description of Model}

\begin{definition}
Let $\Delta[n] = \Delta(-,[n])$ be the standard $n$-simplex formed via the Yoneda embedding in $\textbf{sSet}$.  For each $0 \leq i \leq n$, the \emph{$(n,i)$-horn} is the sub-simplicial set $\Lambda^i[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ which is the union of all faces except the $i^\text{th}$ one.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A map of simplicial sets $f \colon X \to Y$ is a \textit{Kan fibration} if it has the right lifting property for all horn inclusions.  That is, for all $0 \leq k \leq n$, we have the following commutative diagram:
$$\xymatrix{\Lambda^k[n] \ar[d] \ar[r] & X \ar[d]^f \\
\Delta[n] \ar[ur]|{\exists} \ar[r] & Y}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A map $f \colon X \to Y$ in $\widehat{\Delta}$ is a \textit{monomorphism} if it is level-wise injective.  That is, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is an injection of sets $f_n \colon X_n \to Y_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Chapter II, \S 3]{Quillen1967}}]
There is a combinatorial generated model structure on $\textbf{sSet}$, called the \textit{Kan-Quillen model structure}, denoted $\textbf{sSet}_\text{Quillen}$, which has the following classes of morphisms:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Weak equivalences are the morphisms whose geometric realisation is a weak homotopy equivalence in \textbf{Top}.
	\item  Fibrations are the Kan fibrations.
	\item  Cofibrations are the monomorphisms.
\end{itemize}
The cofibrations are generated by the boundary inclusions $\partial \Delta[n] \to \Delta[n]$ and the trivial cofibrations are generated by the horn inclusions $\Lambda^i[n] \to \Delta[n]$.
\end{proposition}

We see that the fibrant objects are those with the lifting property with respect to the Kan fibrations, i.e., the Kan complexes.  All objects in this model are cofibrant as the cofibrations are the monomorphisms.

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Corollary 9.6]{GoeJar99}}]
$\textbf{sSet}_\text{Kan}$ is a proper, simplicial model category. Note, in particular, this implies that the model structure is closed monoidal.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Additional Information}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\textbf{sSet}_\text{Kan}$ can be obtained as a left Bousfield localisation of \hyperref[sset-joyal]{$\textbf{sSet}_\text{Joyal}$} at the class of outer horn inclusions (i.e., horns where $k=0,n$).
\end{itemize}
