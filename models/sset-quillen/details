\subsection{Description of the Underlying Category}

Let $\Delta$ be the simplex category.  That is, $\Delta$ is the category whose objects are linearly ordered sets $[n]=\{0,1,.dots,n\}$ for $n \geq 0$, and whose morphisms are order preserving functions.  The category of \emph{simplicial sets} is then the presheaf category $\textbf{sSet} := \textbf{Set}^{\Delta^{op}}$.

\subsection{Description of Model}

\begin{definition}
Let $\Delta[n] = \Delta(-,[n])$ be the standard $n$-simplex formed via the Yoneda embedding in $\textbf{sSet}$.  For each $0 \leq i \leq n$, the \emph{$(n,i)$-horn} is the sub-simplicial set $\Lambda^i[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ which is the union of all faces except the $i^\text{th}$ one.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A map of simplicial sets $f \colon X \to Y$ is a \textit{Kan fibration} if it has the right lifting property for all horn inclusions.  That is, for all $0 \leq k \leq n$, we have the following commutative diagram:
$$\xymatrix{\Lambda^k[n] \ar[d] \ar[r] & X \ar[d]^f \\
\Delta[n] \ar[ur]|{\exists} \ar[r] & Y}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A map $f \colon X \to Y$ in $\widehat{\Delta}$ is a \textit{monomorphism} if it is level-wise injective.  That is, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is an injection of sets $f_n \colon X_n \to Y_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Chapter II, \S 3]{Quillen1967}}]
There is a combinatorial generated model structure on $\textbf{sSet}$, called the \textit{Kan-Quillen model structure}, denoted $\textbf{sSet}_\text{Quillen}$, which has the following classes of morphisms:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Weak equivalences are the morphisms whose geometric realisation is a weak homotopy equivalence in \textbf{Top}.
	\item  Fibrations are the Kan fibrations.
	\item  Cofibrations are the monomorphisms.
\end{itemize}
The cofibrations are generated by the boundary inclusions $\partial \Delta[n] \to \Delta[n]$ and the trivial cofibrations are generated by the horn inclusions $\Lambda^i[n] \to \Delta[n]$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Corollary 9.6]{GoeJar99}}]
$\textbf{sSet}_\text{Kan}$ is a proper, simplicial model category. Note, in particular, this implies that the model structure is closed monoidal.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Additional Information}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\textbf{sSet}_\text{Kan}$ can be obtained as a left Bousfield localisation of \hyperref[sset-joyal{$\textbf{sSet}_\text{Joyal}$} at the class of outer horn inclusions (i.e., horns where $k=0,n$).
\end{itemize}
